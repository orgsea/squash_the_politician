# squash_the_tory
An unwinnable game, where you squash tories as they pop up on the game board.  I don't condone violence, so instead of squashing the tory with a satisfying splat, they'll instead turn into frogs, that'll make their exit from the screen.  This is meant to be for fun, and I could be persuaded to do one for Labour.  You might guess that this is UK centric.
