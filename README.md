# squash_the_tory

An unwinnable game, where you squash politicians as they pop up on the game board. 
Instead of squashing the politician with a satisfying splat, they'll instead turn into frogs, 
that'll then make their exit from the screen.  This is meant to be for fun.
You might guess that this is UK centric.

I've created a gh-pages branch, which should allow you to play this game
