# squash_the_tory

An unwinnable game, where you squash tories as they pop up on the game board. 
Instead of squashing the tory with a satisfying splat, they'll instead turn into frogs, 
that'll then make their exit from the screen.  This is meant to be for fun, though I am no fan of the UK Tory Party.
You might guess that this is UK centric.

I've created a gh-pages branch, which should allow you to play this game
